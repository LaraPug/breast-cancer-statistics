# Breast Cancer Gene Expression Analysis Portfolio

This repository presents a reproducible gene expression analysis portfolio using breast cancer microarray data from GEO (GSE45827). The project demonstrates data acquisition, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, statistical testing, and visualization in R.

## Overview
This portfolio is built to showcase research-grade data analysis skills with a complete workflow:
- Public dataset retrieval from NCBI GEO with `GEOquery`
- Expression filtering and normalization with `limma`
- Exploratory data analysis including distributions, sample QC, and heatmaps
- Statistical testing for differential expression and sample clustering
- Publication-ready visualization using `ggplot2`

## Installation
Install the required R packages before running the analysis:
```r
install.packages(c("GEOquery", "limma", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "reshape2", "viridis"))
```

## Run the Analysis
Run the full pipeline with:
```r
source("run_analysis.R")
```

Or run each step separately:
```r
source("analysis/01_download_data.R")
source("analysis/02_quality_control.R")
source("analysis/03_exploratory_analysis.R")
source("analysis/04_statistical_testing.R")
```

## Key Results
They took samples before every treatment and compare:
| Grupo                  |  n |
| ---------------------- | -: |
| Triple negativo (TNBC) | 41 |
| HER2+                  | 30 |
| Luminal A              | 29 |
| Luminal B              | 30 |
| Tejido mamario normal  | 11 |
| Líneas celulares       | 14 |

- **Samples analyzed:** 155
- **Genes analyzed:** 14,936
- **Significant genes identified:** 4,064 (`adj.P.Val < 0.05` and `|logFC| > 1`)

The objective of the dataset was to compare gene expression among molecular subtypes of breast cancer and also against normal tissue.
